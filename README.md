# CS754-Project
Study project, bridging the gap between compressed sensing and channel coding problems

Read up about compressed sensing [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compressed_sensing), and channel coding [here](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-21170-1_1).  
We used the parity check matrices used in channel coding for Binary Symmetric Matrices, as measurement matrices in compressed sensing applications.
